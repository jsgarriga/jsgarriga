### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**jsgarriga/jsgarriga** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building up my GitHub profile with data science projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Prediction (Regression), Prediction (Classification), Cluster analysis (Unclassified data) and Advanced data science (Deep Learning).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any of the presented data-science projects or open to other projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with front end applications, ideally displaying the data-science results on a website.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything data-science related, and I'll be happy to help you out.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy drawing when I'm not coding.

### Background

Research student at the Faculty of Political and Social Sciences (Universidad Nacional de Cuyo). Currently, I am doing my internship at Mundo Sur, performing the following tasks: media monitoring, statistical data management, quantitative and qualitative data analysis, report writing. These experiences made me find a new passion in data science. I started coding more often in order to improve my skills. I enjoy automating tasks. Thanks to this I have saved hours of work that I used to complete manually. I started working on predictive analytics projects on my own, even though I wasn't assigned any. I came up with my own ideas, designed solutions, and started implementing them proactively. 

### Interests

- Data science 
- Machine Learning 
- Statistics 
- Engineering and industry 
- Economics 
- Computational Social Sciences.
